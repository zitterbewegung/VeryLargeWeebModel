  - Architecture blueprint (ardupilot_gazebo_integration_guide.md:15): “Claude, explain how the OccWorld stack, Gazebo transport, ros_gz_bridge, MAVROS2, and BEVFusion components should interconnect for multi-agent SITL/HITL, and specify what data flows (JSON/UDP, ROS 2 topics, MAVLink) each link must provide.”
  - Install and stitch dependencies (ardupilot_gazebo_integration_guide.md:78): “Claude, outline the exact shell steps to install Gazebo Harmonic, build ArduPilot SITL (copter/rover), compile ardupilot_gazebo, and set ROS 2 + bridge + MAVROS2 so that everything echoes the guide’s prerequisites.”
  - Sensor rig configuration (ardupilot_gazebo_integration_guide.md:170): “Claude, generate instructions for authoring the six-camera SDF rig, the ground/drone GPU LiDARs, and IMU/GPS sensors with the specified poses, noise profiles, and topics so that BEVFusion and state estimation receive the simulated streams.”
  - RGBD & occupancy setup (ardupilot_gazebo_integration_guide.md:515): “Claude, describe how to add the RGBD camera layer and depth occupancy tiling, including parameters that make the depth map work with OccWorld’s occupancy expectations.”
  - End-to-end launch + automation (ardupilot_gazebo_integration_guide.md:1562): “Claude, create a sequence for launching Gazebo, simultaneous SITL instances, the ROS 2 bridge, and the recorder while highlighting port/instance conventions and required sourced environments.”
  - Automated mission script (ardupilot_gazebo_integration_guide.md:1588): “Claude, walk through the provided DroneKit/pymavlink mission script: explain the connection, arm/takeoff logic, lawn-mower waypoint pattern, and how it ensures stable data capture for the recording pipeline.”
  - Training dataset loader (ardupilot_gazebo_integration_guide.md:1738): “Claude, describe how to implement the GazeboOccWorldDataset loader so it indexes sessions, loads camera/lidar/pose/occupancy tensors, and returns history/future stacks compatible with OccWorld’s training loop.”
